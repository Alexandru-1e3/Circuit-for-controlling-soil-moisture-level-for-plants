The role of the circuit

In todayâ€™s world more and more of the agricultural field gets automatized, with the reason
of making the overall agricultural processes more efficient and faster. One way to improve the work
done in the field is to automate the most vital part of the job, and that is the watering of the plant
part. To make any type of plant grow healthy the amount of water and the frequency of the watering
sessions is crucial. The circuit requirements of a circuit that will automate the process must
consider the length of the watering sessions and the amount of water. It must notify the user when
it starts the process and when it finishes it. It must follow as many safety standards as possible, to
ensure low to zero accidents for the users but also for the surroundings of the circuit.
